# ABOUT THE /brush_management folder

- Contains an addon for brush management.
- This addon will be automatically installed when installing Sculpt+.
- This addon is used to manage all brushes, brush categories, textures and texture categories.
- Sculpt+ will use this addon to feed its custom UI components.
- If the brush_management addon is already installed, the installation process will be skipped.
- In case the current brush_management addon version is lower than the latest (inside Sculpt+), you will get a notification about that in the preferences.
